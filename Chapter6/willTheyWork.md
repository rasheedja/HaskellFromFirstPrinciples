# Will They Work?

1. Yes because length will return an int that can be compared, will return 5, the second list has 5 elements, the first has 3.
2. Yes, a num can be ordered so they can be compared. Will return LT, 3*4 < 3*5
3. No, the two arguments are of different types
4. Yes, they are nums so they can be compared. Will return false because 8 is not greater than 9
